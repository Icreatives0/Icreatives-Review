<h1>About Us</h1>

<div class="container">
  <p><strong>Icreatives Review</strong> is an online literary journal. It encompasses other businesses—graphic, fashion, and creativity—created to let out the silent voice through poetry, fiction, and creative nonfiction.</p>

  <p>Having spent many years administering both online and offline projects for numerous writing, media, and business companies across the globe, Icreatives Review has been able to pick out badass scriveners and those who truly understand what business is. This has made us stand aloof from other companies. We deliver top-notch projects to our clients who are always impressed with our professionalism and creative exposure.</p>

  <p>Icreatives Review will help you call out your creativity and give voice to silent souls with our skills and our team. Instead of trying to pluck an ungrateful fruit—trying to bulldoze the muse—why don’t you just sit, relax, and let us help you do that project?</p>

  <h2>WHAT WE WANT</h2>
  <p>We are selectively bemused in original poems, stories, essays, and other writings that enwrap emotion. They can cut across all genres but must be capable of touching the heart. We want to read characters that live on in our minds long after we down all the pages. We want poems that live on.</p>

  <h2>WHO WE PUBLISH</h2>
  <p>Icreatives Review is open to all kindred spirits all over the world. However, the English language is a general requirement for every submission. That said, we can bend the rules for poems that contain specks of other languages.</p>
